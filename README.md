# Driver Inattention and Drowsiness Detection 🚗👀

## Project Description

This project focuses on the development of a system for detecting driver drowsiness and attention levels using computer vision and machine learning. Key features such as eye closure, yawning, and gaze direction are analyzed to identify poor driving practices. The aim is to create a reliable system that can be integrated into vehicles to monitor drivers and enhance road safety.

## Datasets Used

### 1. **Driver Inattention Detection Dataset** 🚗🧑‍💻
This extensive grayscale dataset is designed for researchers and developers in the field of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. It specifically targets driver behavior analysis and driver assistance systems. The dataset includes over **14,000 labeled images**, divided into six different classes, providing a diverse and comprehensive collection for training, validation, and testing, particularly tailored for processing grayscale images.

- **Classes**: Dangerous Driving, Distracted Driving, Drinking, Safe Driving, Sleepy Driving, Yawn.

### 2. **MRL Eye Dataset** 👁️😴
This dataset is an adapted version of the original MRL Eye Dataset, containing infrared eye images classified into "Awake" and "Drowsy" states. It is divided into training, validation, and test subsets, with more than **85,000 images** captured under various lighting conditions using multiple sensors. The dataset is customized for tasks such as eye detection, gaze estimation, blink detection, and drowsiness analysis in computer vision.

## Project Goals 🎯
- **Detection of Driver Inattention**: Develop a model that can classify the state of the driver based on their facial features, including whether they are engaged in unsafe driving practices like distracted driving or drowsiness.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement a system that can operate in real-time, providing feedback to the driver to improve safety.
- **Model Optimization**: Use machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and performance of the detection models, utilizing the provided datasets for training and testing.
